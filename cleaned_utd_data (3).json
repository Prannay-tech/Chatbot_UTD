    "title":"Campus Carry Statement from UT Dallas",
    "content":"April 11, 2016 Members of The University of Texas at Dallas community: As most of you are aware, the Texas Legislature in 2015 passed Senate Bill 11, which authorizes individuals licensed by the state to carry concealed handguns to carry them onto the campuses and into the buildings of state-governed institutions of higher education. This law takes effect August 1, 2016. Senate Bill 11 also provided the presidents of these institutions with the authority to recommend to their governing boards the details of how their campuses would comply with this law. This past Friday, April 8, I forwarded a letter and my recommendations (pdf) regarding this issue to Chancellor William McRaven of The University of Texas System. My recommendations are based primarily on the extensive and intensive considerations of this issue by the UT Dallas Campus Carry Working Group that I formed last fall. This Group was chaired by Dr. Alex R. Piquero, Ashbel Smith Professor of Criminology and Associate Dean for Graduate Programs in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, and was comprised of 17 members representing all dimensions of the UT Dallas community. Through weekly meetings, the Group discussed the various aspects of Senate Bill 11 and how best to implement them. Our goal was to develop policies that would comply with the law while maintaining the maximum safety and security of UT Dallas students, staff, faculty, and guests. These considerations, along with input from the all-campus town hall held in September 2015, the many submissions to the campus carry email account, and my discussions with Police Chief Larry Zacharias, with our faculty governance group, and with other university presidents, provided the foundation for the policies I recommended to our Board of Regents. There is still much work to be done before August 1, since the policies I have recommended, assuming that they are approved, must be implemented in a variety of details. To assist the UT Dallas administration in this ongoing task, I am appointing a Campus Carry Implementation Working Group that will be headed once again by Professor Piquero. This Group will work on the various guidelines, rules, and practices that are associated with implementing Senate Bill 11, such as signage with respect to gun-exclusion zones. Professor Piquero and this Working Group also will monitor and assess on an ongoing basis the impacts of implementing Senate Bill 11 on students, faculty, staff, and guests. This Group will bring all such concerns to the attention of the president, and we will make all possible adjustments that are consistent with Senate Bill 11 to prioritize the safety and security of our campus. I deeply appreciate the collegial, professional, and mature manner in which the UT Dallas community has dealt with this issue. It is our collective desire that UT Dallas looks and feels the same after August 1, 2016, as it always has: a community of dedicated faculty and staff and ambitious, high-achieving students, all striving to make important contributions to the community, state, nation, and the world through research, education, and service.

Students for whom proficiency in a foreign language is necessary for future research must either pass a translation exam or gain the coursework equivalent of two years of relevant language instruction. Students for whom foreign language research capabilities are not relevant may, with their advisor's permission, petition the Program Head for an exemption. Students must demonstrate relevant language proficiency, or receive an exemption from the language requirement, before scheduling doctoral field examinations. Initial formation of the field exam committee must take place during the semester in which students complete thirty-six semester credit hours. Students should normally complete their doctoral field examinations during the semester in which they complete forty-five semester credit hours, but no later than the semester in which they complete fifty-four semester credit hours. After passing their field exams, students form a four-person supervising committee, normally from the examining committee plus another faculty member proposed by the student, to oversee dissertation work. One member of the supervising committee will serve as the student's dissertation advisor or two members may serve as co-advisors. The supervising committee must then approve a formal dissertation proposal before the student submits it to the Program Head for final approval. Ideally, students will have submitted their dissertation proposals for approval by the beginning of the semester they will complete sixty semester credit hours. Once the proposal is approved, students formally advance to PhD candidacy. Each candidate then writes a doctoral dissertation, which is supervised and defended according to UTDPP1052 . 1.

    "title":"Emergency Preparedness at The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"The safety and security of students and campus employees and visitors are essential components of a great experience at UT Dallas. The following departments have primary responsibility for the safety of the campus community: The University\u2019s Police Department patrols campus 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The department serves the UT Dallas community with a mix of commissioned officers and public safety individuals. The UT Dallas Police maintain a close relationship with public safety teams for the city of Richardson, including its police, fire and emergency management departments. The city of Richardson Fire Department responds to incidents on campus and works with our fire marshal to monitor facilities for fire prevention. The Emergency Management team coordinates a comprehensive, all-hazards approach through all cycles of an emergency \u2014 preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. The Office of Institutional Risk & Safety Programs ensures the campus community has the tools needed to make active safety choices and minimize risks in UT Dallas\u2019 research areas, academic programs, operational and administrative units, student affairs, campus events and neighborhood environment. Student volunteers with University Emergency Medical Response serve as around-the-clock first responders to provide fast, direct Basic Life Support and first aid on campus. Alert systems throughout campus supplement safety efforts. An outdoor siren system warns residents of severe weather or other hazards approaching the area. The siren system typically is tested on the first Wednesday of each month. Indoor voice alert systems are in most academic facilities and residence halls. The UT Dallas community and guests are encouraged to help keep the campus safe by taking the same precautions for personal safety and belongings you would take elsewhere: Plan now to stay informed in an emergency. In emergencies, traditional communications systems can be overwhelmed. The UT Dallas homepage is always the most authoritative source of information in emergencies. But if it should be rendered inaccessible, UT Dallas offers alternative communication channels you should make note of now, before the need arises. How to stay informed: In case of emergency, you can ease communication by doing the following: The WeatherSTEM station on campus provides a micro-local forecast and current weather information for the University. An Ohio State University video provides advice for surviving an active shooter event on a college campus. This video contains graphic reenactments that may be disturbing to some.

    "content":"University Web Services provides support for delivering accurate, current and relevant information on the utdallas.edu website, email and other digital media. It has a primary role in delivering urgent\/crisis communication, content management and promotion of the University\u2019s brand standards on traditional\/PC, tablet and smartphone platforms. The office focuses on user friendliness as the key to integrating the hundreds of sub-websites and web applications that make up the utdallas.edu website. Usability is a top factor associated with return visits and the time end users will spend on the university\u2019s website. We focus a great deal of energy on interactions, design of user interface and behavior of end users to ensure the user experience is a good one. We are responsible for the university\u2019s homepage and other high-traffic webpages. Public-facing applications we support include News Center , Google Customized Search Engine (CSE) , Comet Calendar , and Academic Programs . Websites and emails are increasingly viewed on mobile devices. In 2014, 19% of visits to the UT Dallas homepage came through a tablet or smartphone. University Web Services is actively supporting this trend by implementing responsive design principles to dynamically size the webpage or email to fit the reader\u2019s screen whether it\u2019s a large desktop monitor, tablet or small smartphone screen. Responsive design obviates the need to develop multiple versions of pages for the different devices. Many of our web templates and mass email templates have already been fitted with this code and are available for institutional use. Keyword search is the most popular way of traversing the university\u2019s vast website. Studies show that, on average, websites that give user\u2019s a search option see approximately 60% of their end users use keyword search to navigate compared navigation bars and menus. Websites with younger audiences see higher percentages of navigational search. We work with the university\u2019s community of digital communicators to help them embed keyword search into their pages and make their content easy to find, too. See information on title tags on the Web Guidelines page for the top factor in increasing webpage \u201cfindability.\u201d Blocked images, tiny fonts on a smartphone, and getting trapped in \u201cJunk Mail\u201d are just some of the problems you may encounter when trying to send to a large email list. University Web Services can answer questions about your mass email and make sure it functions in email programs as envisioned. Our editing ensures clarity and congruence with other university messaging. And our quality testing covers desktop email, webmail (such as Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook.com) and smartphone email programs such as iOS Mail and the Gmail app. If you have never worked with us, plan a specific day for your mass email to appear in users\u2019 inboxes and contact Web Services at least two weeks in advance. Review mass email guidelines. University Web Services provides web templates for all sizes of websites. Executed well, a website redesign can be a powerful means to attract and serve prospective and current students, faculty members or the specific audience you serve. Or a redesign can be a complete waste of energy. We would like to help you have the former. University Web Services specializes in creating attractive, compelling, usable websites in a way that highlights usability over flashy effects, effective written content that search engines can find, and future growth. If you are considering a redesign (or original design) for a high-visibility project or you would like our assistance on a smaller project, please complete our client survey. Ask other key stakeholders in your department to complete one too so we have a well-rounded view of what is needed beyond the front page of your website. Be ready to name a subject-matter expert in your area who can give the time it will take to audit, review, edit, create and compile the content. This person should also complete a client survey. Many employees need the ability to edit pages without requiring a web developer\u2019s assistance. To that end, University Web Services supports a highly customized WordPress content management system (CMS) for institutional use (sorry, no blogs allowed). Staff equipped with excellent grammar and spelling skills can usually be trained to edit and publish webpages with 15 minutes of orientation. If the website is not on CMS today, making the decision to move to CMS often goes hand-in-hand with a website redesign. The University complies with Texas Administrative Code 206.70 Accessibility Standard for its webpages. More about web accessibility at UTD . Intercom features campus news, events and stories intended for staff and faculty. The site is accessible via NetID single sign-on. An email is sent to employees every other Friday. There is no \u201copt-out\u201d provision for this communication. University Web Services is responsible for delivering urgent or crisis-related information on the university\u2019s homepage and mobile front page. We test this system monthly, as part of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) with tests of other systems managed by Periodicals, University Police and the Environmental Health and Safety office. We can assist you with collecting revenue online using the university\u2019s Marketplace system. If you need to establish a new storefront, read the university\u2019s credit card policy and contact fms-treasury@utdallas.edu . To add\/remove users or update cost center\/account information in your Marketplace, contact fms-treasury@utdallas.edu . If you have questions about an existing storefront or Marketplace in general, please contact us. A: Explain what you want done and why via the website redesign survey .

Desktop sends to multiple parties often results in a \u201cjunk mail\u201d designation being placed on your message.

    "title":"FAQ for Campus Carry at UT Dallas",
    "content":"\u201cCampus carry\u201d is the common name for the law that authorizes concealed handgun license holders to carry a concealed handgun at public institutions of higher education in Texas. This authorization is subject to the institution\u2019s reasonable rules and regulations. The law, enacted by Senate Bill 11 of the 84 th Legislature, or SB 11, is codified as Section 411.2031, Texas Government Code. No. The law does not grant a universal right to carry a concealed weapon on campus. The person must have a concealed handgun license, meaning they received the state-mandated training and met other requirements, including being at least 21 years of age and a legal Texas resident. Refer to Texas Government Code, Section 411.172 for exact eligibility requirements. No. SB 11 allows license holders to carry concealed handguns in non-excluded locations. It is considered a criminal offense if the license holder carries a partially or wholly visible handgun, or if the person intentionally or knowingly displays the handgun in plain view of another person. The open carry law, or House Bill 910, signed by the Governor in June 2015 specifically excludes university campuses from laws that allow open carry elsewhere in Texas. Call 2222. A handgun license holder is required to keep the handgun out of sight. If you see a person on campus with a weapon, you can help with campus safety by alerting police about suspicious activity. In the event of an emergency, call 911. No. Individuals licensed to carry a concealed handgun are under no obligation to disclose their status as licensed carriers, or whether or not they are carrying a handgun at any particular time, to anyone other than an official peace officer. Under Texas law, only law enforcement can verify whether a concealed handgun license holder is carrying and has a license to carry. A person who fails to comply with the concealed handgun rules and regulations prescribed by the University may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination or dismissal from the University; and may also be in violation of Texas Penal Code Sections 46.03 and 46.035, subjecting the individual to criminal penalties. Handgun license holders have been allowed to carry concealed handguns on campus streets and sidewalks and in parking lots for 20 years. As of Aug. 1, 2016, handgun license holders may carry a concealed handgun in campus buildings unless prohibited by institutional policy or rule. Yes. Specific locations have been deemed \u201cgun exclusion zones.\u201d See the map for details. SB 11 requires that the University give notice to license holders for each building restricting the concealed carry of a handgun. One way that a notice can be provided under Texas Penal Code Section 30.06 is with a sign that: (1) Contains this language \u201cPursuant to Section 30.06, Penal Code (trespass by holder of license to carry a concealed handgun), a person licensed under Subchapter H, Chapter 411, Government Code (concealed handgun law), may not enter this property with a concealed handgun.\u201d (2) Is written in both English and Spanish; (3) Is written with contrasting colors and with block letters at least 1 inch in height; and (4) Is displayed in a conspicuous manner clearly visible to the public. Solely occupied offices can be designated as exclusion zones, prohibiting the concealed carry of a handgun in that space. If occupants choose to exercise this discretion, they must provide oral notice that concealed carry is prohibited in the office. Oral notice is the only legally effective way to provide notice about the prohibition. Written notice or the use of signage does not satisfy notification requirements. The faculty\/staff occupant of an individual office should say to each person entering the office, either: A faculty\/staff occupant of an individual office that chooses to designate the office as an exclusion zone is responsible for ensuring that all persons who enter the office receive oral notification that the carrying of concealed handguns is prohibited in that office. The faculty\/staff occupant should determine how frequently oral notice must be given in order to ensure that all persons have received it. Faculty should be mindful that announcements made in class at the beginning of a semester may not effectively reach all students due to absences or add\/drops. To err on the side of caution, it is recommended that oral notice be provided each time a person enters the office. Unlike solely occupied offices, areas used for disciplinary hearings or mediation will be designated as an exclusion zone by providing either written notification or oral notification. University officials responsible for administering these proceedings have been provided with resources and guidance to comply with the notification requirements. Email campuscarry@utdallas.edu with your suggestion. Read about the process to implement campus carry. No. The University will not provide any training to CHL holders. No, neither the University nor the UT Dallas Police expect a CHL holder to take action in this situation. The decision by a CHL holder to act on their own is the sole decision of that person. The only expectation of a CHL holder, as is the expectation of anyone in this situation, is that they not present themselves as a threat to a police officer and that all orders of the police officer be immediately obeyed. Yes, the President of UT Dallas has the authority to identify situation-specific exclusion zones. The President also may amend the policy as necessary for campus safety. The amended policy goes into effect immediately, unless a two-thirds majority of the Board of Regents votes to overturn the policy or specific portions of it.

This further provides that \u201cThe board may prescribe courses leading to customary degrees offered at leading American universities and may award those degrees. It is the intent of the legislature that those degrees include bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctor\u2019s degrees, and their equivalents.\u201d However, no \u201cdepartment, school, or degree program\u201d can be instituted without the \u201cprior approval\u201d of the Coordinating Board, Texas College and University System. The legislature also provided that \u201cThe board may adopt other rules and regulations for the operation, control, and management of the university that are necessary for the conduct of the university as one of the first class.\u201d These additional rules and regulations are published as the Regents\u2019 Rules.

    "title":"Political Activity on Campus - The University of Texas at Dallas | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"As election season is underway, we are providing guidance on the rights and responsibilities of UT Dallas employees as it pertains to political activities while on campus. Should specific situations not covered within the below summary arise, please contact the UT Dallas Office of Government and Community Relations or the Office of Legal Affairs for assistance. State law recognizes that state employees have the rights of freedom of association and political participation guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions, except as restricted by law. The general restrictions on political activities for state agencies and employees are found in Chapter 556, Government Code , and further defined by the UT System Board of Regents Rules and Regulations (pdf) . Those principal restrictions are as follows: Freedom of speech and assembly are basic rights. However, these activities are subject to the well-established right of institutions of higher education to regulate the time, place and manner in which these activities will be conducted so that they do not intrude upon or interfere with the academic programs and administrative processes of UT Dallas. UT Dallas employees: However, it is permissible for an officer or employee to: Despite the state law restrictions on the use of public resources for a political purpose, there are instances in which institutional facilities may be used by candidates and political organizations. The most common way for a candidate or political organization to appear on campus is by invitation from a registered student organization, although faculty or staff organizations and Student Government may also present off-campus speakers. Under these rules and policies, the registered organization: Registered student, faculty or staff organizations that receive state funds from any source may not request others to vote for or against a candidate ( Rule 80103, Section 2.24 (pdf) ). A registered student, faculty or staff organization that does not receive state funds from any source may engage in these activities, subject to institutional time, place and manner restrictions. However, faculty or staff members or student employees may not conduct these activities during paid work time. UT Dallas has designated specific facilities as \u201cspecial use facilities.\u201d Among other things, these facilities may be used for political conferences and conventions. UT Dallas must charge market-based usage rates that, at a minimum, ensure recovery of the operating costs of the facility that are attributable to the use. No political fund-raising is allowed in special use facilities. If a candidate is also a current officeholder and wishes to make a campaign-related appearance on the UT Dallas campus, the considerations applicable to a candidate\u2019s use of institutional facilities will apply. If the appearance is not campaign-related but related only to the person\u2019s officeholder status, you must ensure that no campaign-related activities occur at the event. A number of state laws and institutional policies govern photography or filming on campus. Unless permitted by other law, it is important to remember that you may not allow photography or filming for a political advertisement to occur on campus. If you are not sure about the intended use of the photograph or film, you should require clarification from the candidate or officeholder. The use of The University of Texas at Dallas logo or trademark in a political advertisement, whether filmed or printed, or for another political purpose, such as an invitation to a political fundraiser or political event or an event conducted by or on behalf of an officeholder, is not permitted, and you should not authorize any such use. 800 W.

    "title":"Tuition - UT Dallas",
    "content":"Your tuition is based on several factors including the number of hours you are taking and costs specific to the program you are pursuing. Cost-of-living expenses vary from student to student based on factors such as personal spending patterns and living arrangement choices. The Office of Financial Aid offers an Estimated Cost Calculator based on the costs of tuition, books and living expenses, such as housing, food and transportation. This calculator can be used to see an average, overall estimated cost of attendance for one academic year at UT Dallas. Prospective and current or admitted students may also obtain a tuition estimate for upcoming semesters. All new incoming students will have the opportunity to choose from two rate plans : the guaranteed tuition plan and the variable tuition plan. The variable tuition rate plan is based on a traditional plan that locks in tuition rates for one academic year at a time. The rates on the variable tuition plan are subject to change each academic year. The guaranteed plan locks in tuition rates for four consecutive years and protects the student against increases during those four years. This plan is designed to aid students and families in the budget and planning of college expenses. New incoming students will be defaulted into the variable tuition rate plan but will have the option to enroll in the guaranteed tuition rate plan. For a comparison of estimated tuition under each of the plans, please visit our Tuition Plan Comparison website. Also, see other fees that may be charged in addition to tuition.

    "title":"Comet Calendar\/Localist User Training - The University of Texas at Dallas | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Welcome to Localist training for the Comet Calendar! The Comet Calendar , powered by the Localist platform, is the University\u2019s go-to resource for discovering and keeping track of campus events. Whether you\u2019re a student worker, faculty member or staff, this training guide will walk you through the platform so you can navigate the Comet Calendar. If you do not already have access to the Comet Calendar, you or your supervisor\/manager can request access by emailing webdeveloper@utdallas.edu with your name, NetID and department\/group for which you wish to submit events. Access is limited to student workers, faculty and staff. Student organizations that want to submit an event can email Megan Moser in the Student Union. For student workers, faculty and staff, there are two access levels: contributors and approvers. Once you have access to the Comet Calendar, you will log on using the \u201cLog In\u201d link on the calendar home page . Through the Office of Information Technology (OIT), Web Services has set up a single sign-on (SSO) for users. So you will use your usual NetID credentials to log in to the platform. And you\u2019re in! The Comet Calendar is for promoting events that are organized, hosted, sponsored or cosponsored by University departments, schools, centers, institutes, alumni organizations, and official, registered student organizations. The primary way to submit an event is using the \u201cSubmit an Event\u201d button on the homepage. It will take you to a submission form with important information. You must be logged in to use the button. On the submission form, the required fields are marked with a grey bubble. However, Web Services highly recommends that you fill in as much information as possible for your event. The form is divided into sections: Once the form is complete, you can submit the event for approval! A secondary way to submit events is in the \u201cCalendar Admin\u201d dashboard. This is an option for Approvers. To get to the dashboard, click the down-facing arrow next to your profile picture. In the dropdown menu, select \u201cCalendar Admin.\u201d Once you are in the dashboard, there will be a blue button that says \u201cAdd Event.\u201d This will take you to the dashboard submission form, which looks different, but has all of the same fields. The form fields are separated into five tabs: Basic Information, Details, Tickets & Registration, Attendee Engagement and Publish . Fill in the important information and submit for approval! The final step in this process is approving the event. Each department and group has approvers that will approve their submitted events. Approvers can not approve events for different departments\/groups. Events are approved on the Dashboard or the Calendar Admin webpage. To get to both options, click the down-facing arrow next to your profile picture. In the dropdown menu, select either the \u201cDashboard\u201d or \u201cCalendar Admin.\u201d Once in the Calendar Admin page, you will see a few blocks at the top. Select the block titled \u201cPending Events.\u201d The number in the box shows how many pending events are in your department\/group. You will find your desire event on the Pending Events page. You then have two options: you can press the Approve link in that event\u2019s table row; or, if you need to review any of the submitted information, you can click the event title, look over everything and select \u201cPublished\u201d from the dropdown at the top of the form. Once on the Dashboard page, you will see a section under Activity Feed called \u201cPending Submitted Events.\u201d Select the event that you are looking for and you will be directed to the event webpage with a banner that reads \u201cThis event is currently waiting for admin approval.\u201d In the bottom right-side column, you will click the green button that says \u201cAdmin Event Editor.\u201d On the Edit Event page, review the content and select \u201cPublished\u201d from the dropdown at the top of the form when ready to approve. If you are no longer going to hold an event or if the date of the event has been changed, update the event title and the descriptive text. DO NOT DELETE THE EVENT. That way, users who have expressed interest in the event will receive a notification that the event is canceled or changed. Users are not notified of deleted events. You must first log in to the Comet Calendar using your UT Dallas Net ID and password to make any changes to an event already submitted. Only approved calendar administrators can make changes to events for their department or group. If you have question about accessing the calendar or updating events, please email webdeveloper@utdallas.edu . 1. Go to the Comet Calendar Admin Dashboard. Go to Search Localist to search events by content or title, user (name or Net ID of event administrator) or group. For more search options, click on the Upcoming Events section to pull up a menu to refine search results by date, target audience, tag and keyword. 2. Select the event you would like to edit from the search result list. 1. Put \u201cCanceled\u201d in the event title. DO NOT DELETE THE EVENT. 2. Add the sentence; \u201cThis event has been canceled.\u201d at the beginning of the event description. If the date has been changed or the event is now virtual, add the word UPDATE: then explain the changes. For example: \u201cUPDATE: This event is now scheduled for May 1, 2020.\u201d 3. SAVE YOUR CHANGES. If you need assistance canceling events that are part of a series, please contact webdeveloper@utdallas.edu . Can\u2019t find what you need?

    "title":"Resilience | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Let your voice be heard. Take part in the Business Continuity Planning survey, launching Spring 2024. Read the announcement: UT Dallas\u2019 Commitment to Resilience View the 2024 Business Continuity & Resilience Training (pdf) . When adverse events occur, The University of Texas at Dallas is prepared to respond, recover and thrive. Challenging disruptions will happen, but we can minimize their impact through preparation. To promote a culture of resilience, UT Dallas will create, test and maintain a Business Continuity Plan supporting the following objectives: In addition to these documented Business Continuity Plan objectives, an implicit benefit of the planning process is the opportunity for all stakeholders to collaborate, thus improving progress toward shared strategic goals . Everyone helps with resilience, and resilience helps everyone. Learn more about the resources available to support the well-being of all individuals associated with UT Dallas. UT Dallas provides numerous resources to keep its units prepared and support the stability of the University. UT Dallas maintains its resilience by planning proactively and following UT System and national guidelines for emergency management. UT Dallas partners with emergency management divisions within our region to help strengthen our overall community resilience. See the latest posts from UT Dallas OEM on Instagram. Please Contact Us to share your resilience stories, ask questions or provide feedback about how you would like to see the University become more resilient. Follow us on social media for resilience tips. Every college and university in the country now understands that traditional planning for crisis events is inadequate. The scale of the problem has changed dramatically and while most of the work done in the past to contend with disasters on campus provided a solid foundation on which to build, a very different kind of preparation and response is now necessary. Resilience is defined as the ability to recover from, or adjust easily to, misfortune or change. UT Dallas continuously works to build resilience into its operations to better serve members of its campus community and beyond. The resilience initiative represents the commitment of all members of the campus, including various projects and awareness education. UT Dallas seeks to be ready for unexpected disruptions while protecting life safety and restoring services as quickly as possible. A set of priorities, outlined above, was confirmed with the University president and cabinet. Not only is planning to recover from disruptions the right thing to do and consistent with our values, but it is also required by the State of Texas, UT System Administration and local policies at UT Dallas. Some have described planning for a disruptive event as a journey, rather than a destination. Plans can be improved continuously to better serve the University. The current Business Continuity Plan remains in effect, though the resilience initiative launched in 2024 supports further improvement to the plan, with a focus on schools\/departments\/units considered to be most critical by the BCP working group. Emergency Response is the most immediate type of program, focused on the safety and security of individuals and property during and following a dangerous event. Business Continuity Planning builds on our strong Emergency Response program by documenting plans for schools\/departments\/units to restore critical services, eventually restoring all services to normal (or close to normal) operations. Events that require Business Continuity Plan activation are expected to last 2 weeks or longer. Disaster Recovery focuses on restoring Information Technology (IT) services such as Internet access, workstations, servers, and applications after a disruption. Because our University is increasingly dependent on IT services, recovering them can be critical to meeting the needs of stakeholders. However, when IT services are offline, UT Dallas will seek to perform as much work as possible using offline methods. Every part of the university contributes value in some way and leaders should consider how to restore services in the event of a disruption. However, certain areas provide the most critical services which protect life safety, for example, or must be functioning to support the operation of other dependent areas. Therefore, University management considers how to prioritize and coordinate recovery efforts in a sequence that favors the most critical areas earlier in the process. As a result, more planning documentation may be requested from schools\/departments\/units identified as critical by the BCP working group, while less critical ones will not be asked to create as much documentation. Achieving resilience is a shared opportunity that requires shared effort. There are parts of the planning process which are addressed by University management on behalf of all schools\/departments\/units. However, there are aspects to planning that are best performed by the schools\/departments\/units directly, where their experience and expertise will allow the best recovery outcomes. Documentation from both university management as well as schools\/departments\/units are then combined into the overall Business Continuity Plan. The resilience initiative and the Business Continuity Planning (BCP) process that supports it are being promoted by the Office of Institutional Risk & Safety Programs and the Information Security Office. This BCP working group will contact appropriate school\/department\/unit personnel at various times throughout each year, as needed, to collect Business Continuity Plan information and help with plan maintenance. The Office of Institutional Risk & Safety Programs and Information Security Office play a supporting role in the coordination of Business Continuity Planning, but they do not have the experience and expertise in each area to sufficiently create all documentation. Instead, a shared responsibility approach is used to collaborate; useful and relevant documentation will need to be provided by the schools\/departments\/units, when requested. Activating the Business Continuity Plan to recover from a disruption is not a small decision. Specific members of the university, including its President, may declare activation of the plan. Disruptive events expected to last two weeks or longer are more likely to result in plan activation. Emergency communications at UT Dallas are broadcast using text messaging, email and the University\u2019s website. Please check with your supervisor or department head for additional information in the event of a disruption. When in doubt or when lacking communication options, the University encourages you to make the best decisions you can in favor of preserving life safety. UT Dallas strives to review its Business Continuity Plan documentation annually and update as appropriate, for example, when significant organization changes have occurred. Taking part in the University\u2019s planning process is both the right thing to do, required by law and policy and subject to review by independent parties such as UT Dallas Internal Audit. While schools\/departments\/units will have differing levels of engagement in the planning process, all should consider how best to meet the needs of stakeholders in the event of a disruption. 800 W.

    "title":"Transcript: The UT Dallas Spirit of Innovation - The University of Texas at Dallas | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"[Dr. Ray Baughman, Professor of Chemistry] We like to make fundamental scientific discoveries, but we\u2019re most excited when these fundamental discoveries lead to inventions that can be used by humankind. [Dr. Joseph J. Pancrazio, VP for Research and Innovation] We make a tremendous effort to move innovations from the bench towards the marketplace. The world is at a point where it absolutely requires the public institutions do more than educate the next generation. They have to be part of the economic development that goes on both regionally and internationally for that matter. [Dr. Richard C. Benson, President of UT Dallas] I am sure that we will continue to be an economic engine for the region. I fully expect UT Dallas to always be on that path of innovation. Together with our partners we will create a future that benefits us all. [Baughman] What we do is we take these fibers and insert so much twist in them that they coil, and these coiled muscle fibers are actually used for these comfort-adjusting jackets which increase their insulating ability as it gets colder. [Dr. Walter Voit, Founder of Adaptive3D] What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re printing structures layer by layer but in the same material we can basically control how stiff that material is just by controlling the geometry, the chemistry, the interfaces, and so this is spawned a whole industry of building parts for cars, for planes, for medical devices. [Pancrazio] People come here with the idea of creating their own future, but doing so now. We have students that put their ideas forward to compete for startup resources, and with it, we do something that\u2019s different from most ivory tower institutions. We actually want to support and nurture these kinds of opportunities for our faculty and students. [Brian Hoang, Co-Founder of SURVIVR] During my time here I started a company called SURVIVR which specialized in immersive training solutions for law enforcement officers, and I was very fortunate because the mentors here were very gracious and patiently explained the building blocks of a company. From formation to sales marketing, product engineering, finance, legal, everything that we needed to get set up and on the ground running. [Dr. Shalini Prasad, Professor of Bioengineering] I work on translating research technologies towards commercial outcomes. So in that context, I do it where I\u2019m helping other companies bring technologies into the marketplace, and one such example is the COVID breath analyzer where we can screen for metabolites for the disease from human breath. [Dr. Nikki Delk, Assoc. Professor of Biological Sciences] I recently started an initiative called Arts for Science that allows me to merge my passions for art and for science in order to raise awareness of the work that my lab is doing here at UT Dallas. [Voit] The university has been paramount in our commercial success. All of the core materials, innovations and chemistries that were discovered were done here at the university. We were acquired last year by Desktop Metal, we\u2019re publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, we\u2019ll do about a quarter billion dollars in top line revenue this year, we have assets in 60 countries all over the world. [Hoang] Within three years we expanded to 10 states with customers from law enforcement agencies, to universities, private security firms, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and it was profoundly life-changing. I mean it was quite literally the American dream. [Prasad ]So the environment at UTD is highly entrepreneurial. It gives you the flexibility and the agility that helps us reduce the cycle times for us to get technologies out. [Baughman] About half of my 106 issued U.S. patents were because of work and inventions that we made at UTD. We have a team of patent lawyers who help with this process, help ensure that these patents are issued in a timely way. [Delk] When I do the STEM outreach I\u2019m able to bring high school students into my lab here at UT Dallas to get research experience and so the university has been supportive in that regard. [Prasad] All of this can happen here at UT Dallas. At the same time companies that want to bring to life these innovations can partner with us so we can truly impact our region. [Voit] We\u2019ve centralized a lot of the polymer processing manufacturing and development in the Richardson IQ, so we can take advantage of the incredible business environment here in Texas and also the intellectual capital that comes out of UTD. [Pancrazio] The Innovation Quarter is the phoenix that is rising from the ashes of the Telecom industry, and with it, we have the opportunity to be part of a tremendous experiment. [Hoang] Since the acquisition I\u2019ve returned to UT Dallas to mentor the up-and-coming startups here, and to me, personally that\u2019s one of the most meaningful ways that I can give back after all that they have given me when I first started my company. [Pancrazio] We don\u2019t know where the next great idea is going to come and we have to have full engagement of everybody in representation such that we can have a chance to lead the way towards the next innovation. [Prasad] Diversifying workforce and diversifying faculty in a higher education institution is critical because diverse people and diverse ideas bring up great quality within an institution. Aspire2 is our first step towards building and diversifying pipelines of faculty and training the next generation of faculty. [Delk] Aspire2 is a National Science Foundation program and one of the main goals of the Aspire2 program is to attract women faculty to the university. [Prasad] Towards this end we are doing three things. We are working on the climate of UTD to make it supporting for people from all walks of life. Second thing is of course recruitment of this new generation of faculty with a focus on underrepresented minorities. [Delk] So one of the activities that the Aspire2 program here at UT Dallas will be doing is having a workshop called the Future Faculty Identification Program Workshop. [Prasad] And the last, of course, is essentially ensuring the retention is wonderful so that the people whom we bring want to stay here and help us build the next generation of a university. Thank you for your time, and I wish you all the best. 800 W. Campbell Road Richardson, Texas 75080-3021 972-883-2111 \u00a9 The University of Texas at Dallas Questions or comments about this page?"

    "title":"Transcript: Staff Council Speech",
    "content":"Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Jennifer Klunk, and it is my honor to continue to serve as Staff Council President for this year. I\u2019d like to start off by paraphrasing the Staff Council mission statement, which is part of our bylaws. Staff Council is an advisory body through which elected staff members convey information and make recommendations to the University President regarding the interests and concerns of Staff. We are constituted by the University President, and by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System, with the goal of continually improving university operations and the well-being of UT Dallas\u2019 staff. So, what does that mean, exactly? Through Staff Council, members of UT Dallas staff community make suggestions for change that have an impact on all staff. We are many voices, and together we are a stronger, more effective community. We asked staff to tell us their thoughts on remote work, and you did \u2013 we received over a thousand responses, which were reported to campus leadership with the aim of finding a workable hybrid model for more staff. You asked us to address concerns around parking, and we did \u2013 our proposal resulted in a partial refund of parking costs to those staff on campus during the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to work towards the concrete concerns around employment equity, looking to provide new approaches to staff recruitment and retention using historical employment data. These are just a few of the many topics addressed over the last year. More details can be found in our annual report on the Staff Council website. This year we challenged you to help us come up with a new piece of artwork that represents Staff Council, and you did. With the words \u2018Service, Advocacy, Impact\u2019, we move forward more committed than ever to speaking the concerns of staff into the decision-making processes of campus. We are in a time of dramatic change, both globally and at UTD. I think it\u2019s fair to say none of us would have predicted the last 3 years. But change takes time, and we continue the hard work of being agents of change. This includes improving relationships across campus, building bridges between all levels of the campus community. Sometimes hard questions are asked, including this one \u2013 When will staff become a priority at UTD? This is a direct quote from a suggestion submitted to Staff Council, and while I am hopeful for positive change always, I have to acknowledge that morale has been a problem. A member of campus community once told me, \u201cI just want to make UTD as great as I know it can be.\u201d I want to echo these sentiments \u2013 I believe in UT Dallas as an institution, a workplace, and as an agent of positive change in the metroplex and beyond. To continue to move forward, we must face the challenges directly, and work towards a more equitable outcome for every staff member of our campus community. 800 W.

    "title":"Transcript: Academic Senate | UT Dallas",
    "content":"Good afternoon. My name is Ravi Prakash. I am a professor of computer science. But today, today in my capacity as Speaker of the Academic Senate, it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the first in three years State of the University address at UT Dallas. It\u2019s been a year since the University returned to in-person classroom teaching for most courses. While life has returned to normal for most, there are still those among people who silently carry the scars of COVID-19. Some are still struggling silently with the lingering effects of the disease and some have lost family and friends. Two years back, in this very forum, online, I urged all of us to show grace to others. It\u2019s just as important today as it was then. Disruptions to important parts of our professional life, like laboratory research, human subject experiments, field-work, and manuscript preparation will take several years to overcome. Let us be mindful of that as we, the faculty members, help each other get back in stride. Our relatively new colleagues, who arrived when mentoring and support systems were in disarray, are most in need of our help. On a positive note, during the last year the Academic Senate has had several accomplishments. These include work in progress to benchmark remuneration, address salary inversion and compression, creation and implementation of the emeritus faculty policy, clarity on the use of student course evaluations, and improved representation of graduate students on various senate and university committees, and steps towards sustainability by long-term elimination of single-use plastics on campus. We have reason to be proud of shared governance at UTD. Healthy shared governance doesn\u2019t mean we never have differences. Health of shared governance is measured by how we communicate and how we resolve those differences. The compromise on how to pay for Graduate Research Assistant health insurance out of existing grants is an example of the Academic Senate and university administration working towards a solution that both parties could agree upon. But we could do better. Insufficient or last-minute consultation on issues that directly impact faculty performance and morale are not conducive to good decision-making. That said, I believe the university leadership has its heart in the right place when it comes to shared governance. Dear students in this audience, if you think your professors create tough exams and ask difficult questions, you should see the questions these same professors ask President Benson and Provost Musselman every Senate meeting. You could also learn a lot from the sincerity and candor with which President Benson and Provost Musselman and all the vice presidents answer those questions! Shared governance is also strengthened when the entire university zealously protects academic freedom. In a democracy, transient majorities, with their own ideological inclinations, may come into political power at various times. But our permanent adherence to truth, rational and impartial analysis of facts and data, and dogged determination to go where the facts take us should persist, no matter the direction in which the political wind blows. This can, and has, created conflict since American universities came into being. In the 1830s a group of students at the Lane Seminary in Cincinnati formed an antislavery society. The board of trustees did not like it and, in retaliation, dismissed a professor. Immediately before and during the Civil War, professors at the universities of Georgia and Iowa, and Bowdoin College, and the President of Dartmouth University were dismissed for their positions on the war that ran contrary to those of the board of trustees at the corresponding universities. After the Civil War, professors were driven out of several universities for teaching evolution. In the 1950s and 60s, states including New York and Oklahoma required state employees, including college professors to take loyalty oaths swearing that they didn\u2019t belong to subversive or communist organizations. Supreme Court opinions striking down such loyalty oaths have emphasized academic freedom for professors as an integral part of the First Amendment. Justice Frankfurter characterized teachers as, \u201c\u2026 the priests of our democracy \u2026 who foster habits of open-mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible citizens\u2026. They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied to them.\u201d End of quote. A few years later, in another majority opinion, Justice Frankfurter \u2014 also a former faculty member at Harvard Law School \u2014 spelled out the four essential freedoms of a university, and I quote again: \u201cto determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.\u201d End of quote. He went on to write, \u201cNo one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.\u201d End of quote. But, what about the belief that the one who pays the piper gets to call the tune? If a state provides financial support for an organization, can the state promote one kind of speech over another at that organization? A distressing example of that is the majority opinion written by Justice Rehnquist, in 1991 in Rust v. Sullivan, which allowed congress to fund medical clinics under the condition that these clinics did not support abortion as a method of family planning. Sounds like a different era, doesn\u2019t it? Even in that opinion, Justice Rehnquist explicitly states that such restrictions cannot be imposed on universities. Hence, academic freedom is, and should be, a bi-partisan, or better still, a non-partisan idea. We can only hope that soon academic freedom will cease to be a politically divisive issue. Until then, like any freedom, we must protect it zealously. I\u2019m very proud of the Academic Senate resolution in favor of academic freedom, adopted in the March meeting, and am looking forward to the Academic Senate debate on the Academic Freedom Policy, later this week \u2014 actually tomorrow. In conclusion, we at UT Dallas have much to be proud of, including the scholarship of our faculty and students, the dedicated service of members of our staff, and the strong support of share governance among staff, students, faculty and the administrative leadership. 800 W.

    "title":"Transcript: Student Government - The University of Texas at Dallas | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Hello Comets! My name is Kruthi Kanduri and I am your current Student Government President. It is my pleasure and a significant honor to be able to speak on behalf of our Student Body today. As SG President and a Comet myself, the biggest shift I see in this campus is in our community. Not only are we rebuilding and reimagining our wonderful in-person traditions such as orientation, Weeks of Welcome, and other long-withstanding events but we are also coming together to make our University a more positive and active one. Currently, we are an undergraduate body of seniors who were in-person before the pandemic, juniors who started out completely virtual, and underclassmen who started their Comet journey in a hybrid and post-COVID world. Each student here has gone through their own journey of growth and now serves as a resource and guide for all those who will come after them. 2022 is a significant year because while it does mark a new generation of campus culture, it also signifies growth. We are experiencing growth in our numbers as well as growth in our campus structure, campus traditions, and more. At the end of the last year, we merged our School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication and our School of Arts and Humanities to create our School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology. This merger is one of many new changes that mark a significant shift within the University. Also included in this shift is the construction of exciting new additions on campus such as the Crow Museum Expansion and Athenaeum, which promises to become a haven where students can appreciate the arts. Most recently, the student population voted YES to build a brand-new Student Union, which is representative of our growing University. And with the growth of the University, we also see a growth in Student Government. As of today, we are almost at a full Senate of 75 active members who are eager to represent their constituents (that\u2019s all of you!) and work on projects to improve student life and impact the student experience. While we grow as a university, we are also setting records and breaking ceilings. We are one of three Texas public universities to be ranked in the US News list of the top 100 US public universities, and according to Forbes, we are also ranked the #1 Best Value University in all of Texas. We achieved these rankings while still in the pandemic, working asynchronously, online, and in hybrid modalities. Excited doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the way I feel when I think of all the ceilings we\u2019ll break this year. Student Government is also dedicated to breaking ceilings this year and is focused on being the most efficient and representative version of ourselves. In 2022, we eliminated the GPA requirement to be a Senator and passed multiple resolutions representing the student voice regarding the hybrid education modality. Additionally, we brought brand-new initiatives to campus such as the Blank Space project that brought student art to the forefront of the Student Union walls as well as our Women in Leadership event that connected women leaders across the student body, administration, faculty, and local government. This year, we hope to not only increase student engagement but also increase transparency and make campus resources for students easily accessible. Before I pass the mic to President Benson, I urge each and every student to remember that Student Government is your voice and we serve you. If you have any feedback, ideas, concerns, or questions \u2013 let us know as that\u2019s what helps us grow and become better representatives for you. And at the end of the day, that will always be our first and foremost responsibility. 800 W.

    "title":"Transcript: Graduate Student Assembly - The University of Texas at Dallas | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Hello, Comets. Good afternoon. I am Megha Hooli, second-year master\u2019s student in Business Analytics and the current President of Graduate Student Assembly. I am here today representing Graduate Student Assembly. And I am honored to represent almost 9,000 graduate students at UT Dallas. Thanks to the help of President Benson making, we, as the governing body and many other supporters at the university. This was a significant step in ensuring graduate student voices will be always represented on campus. In the past year, GSA has fought for the initiative related to pandemic, like TA insurance waiver, diversity, and many more. And many events which will positively impact graduate students. As Dr. Prakash was saying that the TA insurance waiver was really helpful for the all the graduate students. Now that we are all back to school, we have different problems like the current GSA team is working on mental health struggles, back to schools, TA\/RA stipend increase, and better connectivity at UTD public transport \u2014 which is a DART issue that we are, which is one of the biggest issue for all the graduate students\u2013 diversity initiative, and many more. I can assure you that GSA will continue to fight for these goals over this upcoming year and beyond until change occurs. As a student governing body, our sole purpose is to improve overall experience of you as a graduate student at UT Dallas. We organize on-campus events, engage with university departments and organizations, to push for initiatives that would benefit you. Hence, I urge all the grad students to attend events and initiatives. These events will allow you to learn about the faculties or facilities available for you at UT Dallas, socialize with other graduate students, and participate in networking opportunities that could potentially open doors to your future career. Our General Meetings are scheduled for the last Friday of every month. We encourage every one to participate and speak up at the problems that you\u2019re facing at UTD. This is an opportunity for all the grad students to raise their voice for changes they would like to have as graduate students at UT Dallas. As a fellow graduate student, I know this endeavor comes with unique opportunities and challenges. GSA recognizes this and strives to develop a network that would benefit you. This year, the GSA is eager to strengthen the sense of community among the graduate students at UT Dallas. We hope we can count on your support to make our council a robust and inclusive voice for all graduate students. College can be overwhelming, humbling, and even painful at times. Although it is not easy, you all adapt to it eventually. It is like riding a rollercoaster, but before riding it, you must convince yourself that you like rollercoasters. So, trust the process; I know UTD will help you achieve your goals. Please reach out to me if I can help you in any way. GSA remains the mission to meet the needs of graduate students at University of Texas at Dallas so that they can flourish in all areas of life while receiving a degree from a top-ranking university. Thank you for your time, and I wish you all the best. 800 W. Campbell Road Richardson, Texas 75080-3021 972-883-2111 \u00a9 The University of Texas at Dallas Questions or comments about this page?"

    "title":"Transcript: State of the University - The University of Texas at Dallas | The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"State of the University address presented by President Richard C. Benson on Oct. 18, 2022 Well, good afternoon everybody. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all here. It\u2019s been three years. It\u2019s been a little while, so it\u2019s nice that we finally get to gather again \u2014 back together in this spot. I want to note that a key contributor to this talk \u2014 you\u2019re going to see lots of numbers \u2014 and anything that involves lots of numbers involves Larry Redlinger. And Larry, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in the room somewhere, but Larry has served four presidents \u2014 all but Bryce Jordan \u2014 in helping, you know, keep the data of this University. So I really want to tip my hat to Larry as we launch into this. So thank you very much. So many of you, of course, have heard my stump speech, so as I\u2019ve said, try to laugh in all the right spots. You know, pretend like you haven\u2019t heard it before. But this is an amazing graph. This is an incredible graph. We are consistently among the nation\u2019s fastest growing universities. In my presidency, we\u2019ve been anywhere from sixth to second in the nation and you can see it here. And so you \u2014 and a lot of this is David Daniel I might point out \u2014 and the work that people did on his watch as president. And you see a rare dip in Academic Year \u201921, where we actually dropped by a thousand students from the prior year. Where \u2014 and of course every year \u2014 had been a record. Then we dropped by a thousand students and a lot of that was due to the fact that a lot of our graduate students simply couldn\u2019t come into the country back then. Many of them were from India. So they wanted to come; they were admitted, but they couldn\u2019t come into the country. A year ago we had gained it all back. We were all the way back to where we had been and I am told that we were one of only five public universities in the state of Texas that actually grew from the fall of \u201920 to the fall of \u201921. And then this last year we added another 2,000. So again, UTD is definitely on its way back and you see this by people voting with their feet. I like to say in the stump speech that no one is obligated to send their tuition dollars to UTD. There are many good places where you could do that but, to an ever-increasing extent, people are choosing to come to UT Dallas. Here you see a bit of a breakout of the student body. You see we\u2019re more male than female. This is actually a rare university that is that way. I\u2019m an engineer by profession and we have a lot of engineering students and most of the engineers are men. And so this is reflected in that demographic. We\u2019re about one-third graduate to two-thirds undergraduate. That\u2019s actually a very good ratio. That\u2019s kind of where we like it to be, so that\u2019s very strong. And you can also see the split between full-time and part-time. The student profile also shows that, needless to say, we attract a lot of students from Texas, especially north Texas. I might point out that with every passing year, though, we start to see a spread in that demand. We start to see more students from San Antonio and Houston and other places, and we see them from other states in the nation. And of course, on the graduate side, we have a great many students from India and, you know, other countries are represented. By the way, our oldest student is 88 and I\u2019m told that \u2014 let\u2019s see if I can go back \u2014 that they are pursuing a doctorate in humanities, so wish them well. So here\u2019s another slide that means a lot to me. Again, you see the 31,000 students, but it\u2019s that middle row that I want to draw your attention to. And again, when I speak to especially external audiences, people know that we have just a first-rate student body here. We have just a stunning student body. In fact, it was Hobson Wildenthal \u2014 who often said that our job one was to hire a faculty worthy of our students. And I think that\u2019s a good way to look at it. But look across that row. I\u2019ll start in the middle. You see that two-thirds of our students receive some form of aid, either need-based or merit-based aid. So even though we have a relatively high tuition in the state of Texas \u2014 I don\u2019t have a chart for this \u2014 but at the back end, our debt numbers are among the lowest in the state. And it\u2019s because we do so much to help support our students when they\u2019re here. To the left you see 42 percent are considered to be economically disadvantaged. This is by the Coordinating Board. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re poor, but it means that maybe they\u2019ve had a hard road; maybe they\u2019ve worked for a while \u2014 they\u2019ve come back to school. But so in other words, it\u2019s been a challenge. They\u2019re not just the usual student, who after finishing high school, comes straight away into college. And over at the right, you see almost a third of our students are on Pell Grants and these grants \u2014 which are federal \u2014 do go to students from needy backgrounds. And I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we support our students so handsomely. Look also \u2014 one in five, almost one in five \u2014 is first generation and I can tell you that in a long career over multiple universities, probably the most precious thing that we do is to educate those first generation students because it completely changes their lives and it changes the lives of their own children and so on. I mean it\u2019s hard to do something more meaningful than that. Charging ahead, you get a sense of what the entering, first incoming students, are seeking. You see 36 percent are sort of aimed at engineering and computer science. JSOM also attracts a very sizable number. You know, mixed in all of this, you see a lot of programs like biology, healthcare studies, neuroscience, psychology. A lot of students who maybe are aiming toward a career in medicine or health care. Number one is computer science. They\u2019ve been number one for a while. Ravi might know, but I think one in eight students is majoring in computer science, some stunning fraction \u2014 I might have that number wrong so don\u2019t hold me to it. If you also look to the left, we have a record number of freshmen this year and also 227 National Merit Scholars. So again, for my friends who have heard this joke, if you see the list of the top 20 schools that attract National Merit Scholars \u2014 and we usually stand around fifth \u2014 they\u2019re either very elite private universities like Harvard or they\u2019re public universities with ferocious football teams like Florida. All right. And so we don\u2019t play football and we\u2019re not private, so it\u2019s kind of interesting that we break into this list. That these National Merit Scholars have found UTD and are choosing to come here. You see the number of degrees that we\u2019ve awarded by Academic Year. There are a couple of very interesting things. I\u2019m going to start at the bottom \u2014 that\u2019s the number of doctoral graduates that we turn out \u2014 PhDs and audiology doctorates. For the longest time that number stood right around 200. It was 190, 200, 201, back to 190, and then we really jumped it up. It went to 251, 228, 260, 257, etc. So this is very much in the direction where we\u2019re trying to go. In fact, our Strategic Plan \u2014 which I\u2019ll get to a little bit later \u2014 calls for us to get to about 275 on an annual basis and we\u2019re pretty much getting there. If you notice before Academic Year \u201918, we tended to graduate about one master\u2019s student for every bachelor\u2019s student and that\u2019s very unusual. There\u2019s hardly a university where it\u2019s kind of in a one-to-one ratio. And what you see is our undergraduate graduates have gone up, but the master\u2019s numbers have really dropped down significantly. Some of this is due to a long-ranging trend that started back around 2016, where students from foreign countries were not coming to the United States in the same numbers that they had been. And that included UTD. And of course, then we had the COVID year, so that relatively low number of master\u2019s graduates last year is about to turn and go back up again. I\u2019m going to show you the enrollment numbers, but you will see that the master\u2019s numbers will start going back up again. We did something really nice this spring. We had an all-university commencement ceremony \u2014 probably for the first time at least in decades, maybe the last time was when we could all fit into one room and we had you know 20 graduates \u2014 so this was nice. This was held out on the circle just south of JSOM. It was lovely weather. It was a great event. There was music; there were fireworks. If you look carefully, you can see John Olajide, one of our most distinguished alumni giving a talk to the graduates. So it was just a really nice new tradition for UTD and one that we will continue going forward. A couple other points that I want to make. We always rank very high on the support of active military and veterans, so this particular slide acknowledges a Gold Award. This is given by the state of Texas, but again, it\u2019s to recognize excellent support of military, active military and veterans and we really do have a great center for them. And I don\u2019t know if we have any veterans in the audience, but you mean a lot to us and we try to take good care of you. So we play sports. We\u2019re NCAA Division III. I think Gene Fitch is out there somewhere, and we\u2019re in the American Southwest Conference. I think by student body, we\u2019re probably equal to the entire rest of the conference put together and so they don\u2019t like it very much. Now I would say that we play small, though. I mean we have a lot of graduate students and you know not everybody plays sports, but we do awfully well, and so we have wonderful sports teams. These are great young men and women and you can see a number of championships there. This is just over the last year, but you\u2019re also going to see some distinguished scholar awards, freshman of the year awards. You know these sorts of things \u2014 academic all-ASC, so it\u2019s really nice. These are terrific members of our student body. And here you see a couple of others. You see Ramon Garza, who was a Division III All-American. This is an NCAA All-American. And here you see two tennis players Suzuka Nishino and Samantha Wong \u2014 who were also All-American in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. So again these are national honors. Karen Alvarez \u2014 this is the NCAA Elite 90. So there are 90 championship sports held by the NCAA, and if you are a competitor in that, those of you who have the highest GPA win this award. So she\u2019s won that two years running. So I\u2019m just guessing she\u2019s a 4.0 student, just to guess and she plays a mean game of golf. We have a very fine track and field team. I\u2019ve often pointed out that we unfortunately don\u2019t have a track and we don\u2019t have a field. But that minor inconvenience aside, we do rather well. So we\u2019ve added both men\u2019s and women track and field \u2014 both indoor and outdoor \u2014 and I think it takes our total to 17. We play at John Paul II High School, nearby so that that is where we find a track to run about. I like these photos they\u2019re a little fuzzier than some of the others. I think it\u2019s because they\u2019re running so fast. More in athletics. We also have esports. So we have a really fine esports team and they\u2019re ranked in the top 10 as we speak and they\u2019ve won two national championships in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. Way to go, esports. I don\u2019t know if we have any of our esports out in the audience but you guys are stars. We also do our sports as in real sports and so this is kind of fun. So our cheerleaders and our mascot were in a national competition in Florida in Daytona Beach last May. And our Power Dancers finished second in their category and Temoc finished fourth. Now I\u2019m trying to figure out who were the three that beat Temoc? I mean, obviously so, but in any event pretty good showing for Temoc and the Power Dancers. Way to go. You heard just a short mention a while ago that we merged two schools. So Arts Technology and Emerging Communications and Arts and Humanities to form Arts, Humanities, and Technology. And I see our dean, Nils Roemer, sitting here in the front row. I am so excited by this. This brings together people who in fact have worked closely together for a long time and there\u2019s just such an interesting intersection between the two former schools. I\u2019d like to point out a lot of universities have very terrific arts and humanities and they have terrific technology, but you don\u2019t see the AH and the T all put together. This is such a UT Dallas kind of thing to do, because you know, we pride ourselves in being nerdy, right? But when we do technology, we do it in a very artistic way, right? If you think about it, the arts and humanities should inform technology and vice versa. So we just have this beautiful new school. We\u2019re sitting kind of in the midst of it, in the heart of it, and in fact, if you walk the building later, you\u2019ll see some of that creativity right in front of you. So this is a very exciting new development for UTD. Also after the pandemic, we finally started to march ahead on Education Abroad. As you can imagine it was impossible, over two years. So we had a kind of fledgling program that we started in Switzerland and France. I think the number of students \u2014 there were 37 students \u2014 is on the slide. This is great. I\u2019m a big believer in this. It\u2019s very important. I think it just does so much to open people\u2019s eyes as to the value of knowing what\u2019s going on in other parts of the world. So we have intention to greatly expand this to include \u2014 I\u2019ve got a list here of some of the countries \u2014 Ghana, Guyana, Morocco, Ecuador, Mexico, Japan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland. And I also want especially for our students in the audience to know we greatly subsidize the cost of these trips. We know that many students are somewhat nervous about it. They think they can\u2019t afford it; but, in fact we have some great programs in place to support it. And I kind of like the fact that we\u2019ve got some photos here of people doing the Whoosh, at Giza, Pisa, Paris and Shanghai. I\u2019ve been at three of those places. I didn\u2019t have the good sense to do a Whoosh, though, when I was there. As we think back on the COVID pandemic, you know it was a tough couple of years and our students in particular really needed help, so we got some money through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. It actually came in three phases, but I just want to remind you that we put over a million dollars into the hands of our students who really needed it. Maybe they lost a job, maybe one of their parents lost a job, maybe they had food insecurity, maybe they needed to buy technology that they didn\u2019t have as we all moved online. So we made sure that we did the best possible that we could. We also created our own homegrown fund, the Student Emergency Fund and my understanding is that that\u2019s from you \u2014 that didn\u2019t come from the federal government. This is money that we all contributed to. And it\u2019s close to $600,000 that we were able to bring together, again to help support our students in need. I know many in the audience contributed to that fund, so thank you very much. A couple other things. Of course we\u2019ve been moving rapidly to using greater technology. This is maybe almost a routine thing now, but we have a very fine mobile app. If you haven\u2019t gotten it, I recommend it. No surprise our students tend to be early adopters compared to faculty and staff, but again we have a very good mobile app, which can pretty much tell you everything you need to know about your life at UTD. I\u2019ve mentioned that we\u2019ve made a few changes so I want to just touch on a few leadership changes. On the left, you see Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, our dean of graduate education. But he\u2019s also now the vice provost for global engagement and as I mentioned, this is an important new thrust for us. And Nils, who was the director of the Holocaust Center, is now the dean \u2014 the inaugural dean \u2014 of Arts, Humanities, and Technology. And here you see Steven Spiro, vice provost for faculty affairs; Ingrid London, assistant provost for admissions and enrollment operations; Karen Huxtable-Jester, director \u2014 a new director of the Center of Teaching and Learning; and Robert Clarke, senior director of financial aid. Thank you all for your service, your new service. Maybe I won\u2019t read off all of the names here, but we do awfully well with things like NSF Career Awards, Young Investigator Awards, NIH Career Awards. Here you see some of the young faculty members \u2014 I think they\u2019re young \u2014 who have come to UTD in recent years, most of them by definition would have been just a few years past their own PhD. It is just such a nice thing to see these talented individuals who\u2019ve chosen to continue their degree, their career at UTD when they could go pretty much any place. Let me assure you \u2014 and they\u2019re here and I got a couple of deans sitting in front of me \u2014 so you\u2019ve played a major role in making this the place of choice for these fine faculty members. Thank you very much, and when you see those research graphs going up, it\u2019s a lot of these recent hires that we\u2019ve made who are really contributing to it. Our provost had a great year in hiring new faculty last year, so 43 new tenure to tenure track faculty. We get very good support from UT System, by the way. Where you see a star, this is an individual working in the STEM disciplines, and if you work in one of the STEM disciplines, UT System stands ready to put some money into helping you develop your laboratory, if you will. The blue star is for a mid-career existing faculty member and a rising star would be someone at the front end of their career. We\u2019ve done very, very well in being able to attract some additional support from UT System and by the way, this is competitive. We don\u2019t get it just for asking; we have to convince the folks at UT System that these are among the best of the best. But again, every name on that list is a great value to UTD and we\u2019re so glad that they\u2019ve chosen to come here. President\u2019s Teaching Excellence Awards \u2014 again just wonderful individuals. I know some of them to varying degrees \u2014 John Zweck and Selena Brody honored for undergraduate education; Shalini Prasad \u2014 I think I saw Shalini out there somewhere \u2014 for graduate instruction; Carrie King for blended instruction; and Siri Wilder, a teaching assistant. I want to tip my hand to all of the TAs who are out there. You are an important part of the teaching mission here at UTD. Additional teaching awards \u2014 you see Milind Dawande, graduate research mentoring; Jason Slinker for undergraduate research mentoring; Carol Cirulli Lanham, who\u2019s been elected to the UT System Academy of Distinguished Teachers. And I might point out, you don\u2019t get into that academy if you haven\u2019t previously won a ROTA award, which is a good segue to this year\u2019s ROTA Awards or Regents\u2019 Outstanding Teaching Award. So congratulations to Selena Brody and Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, two of our most recent teachers honored at the system level. Again, this is an honor where people are nominated from every campus in the UT System. Back to research a little bit more. I actually mentioned the federal research expenditures in an earlier slide, and I would just remind you again, it\u2019s up 68 since Fiscal Year \u201917 If you look at the lower graph. The point I like to make here is that this is the hardest money to get. This is highly, highly competitive. We\u2019re getting money from the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, NIH, you name it. There\u2019s other pretty fine faculty members at places like Caltech and Stanford and MIT and the like, and they would like that money, too. So, to an ever-increasing extent, we are proving successful in attracting these research funds to come to UTD. And another thing that you might note there is that there is no COVID dip. Joe Pancrazio is sitting here \u2014 he and his entire Research and Innovation team really did a fantastic job throughout the pandemic. We kept our labs going \u2014 you know some of them have living creatures in them, so we kept the labs up and running. Maybe only one-third of the people were there at any one time, but we could still write proposals; we could still work up our results. And so our research just continues to grow at a really nice clip. The total research expenditures did show a COVID dip and, interestingly enough, I think it\u2019s entirely due to lack of travel. We just didn\u2019t fly to faraway places or pay conference fees the way we used to. But you can see that we\u2019re back up now to another record level. So research is a very strong element right now at UTD. In fact, throughout the pandemic \u2014 and I have witnesses who know I said it \u2014 but it was a bright spot. When things were really grim, the fact that our research was moving ahead just really brought a lot of joy. We also say in our strategic plan that we\u2019re going to be an economic engine for the region. One of the most important things that we\u2019ve done recently is to partner with the City of Richardson in what they call the Richardson Innovation Quarter or Richardson IQ. This is in some repurposed space not far from here, about five miles out toward 75. And we have moved six laboratories over there, but not just any six. These are six that work very much at the intersection with industry partners and also in a domain where you\u2019re pretty close to commercialization. In other words you can see that some good work will come out of it, and the whole point there is to really focus as much on the \u201cI\u201d \u2014 the innovation \u2014 as the research. We just cut the ribbon on that, maybe about a month back, maybe it was two months back, but this is very exciting. This is again a really nice way in which the impact of UTD goes to a broader level. And forging some new collaborations. This again comes out of the Office of Research and Innovation. We had an inaugural research day \u2014 it was held over at the Alumni Center. We pretty much filled that ballroom area. It was lovely and a lot of our faculty were presenting their work. Really nice. There are two things, and for the sake of time I won\u2019t dig into it, but the LEAP Manufacturing Next-Generation Battery Workshop is kind of important because battery technology is really important to the future, whether it\u2019s if you\u2019re going to drive an EV car or even just your own electronics, and also just for power delivery. You know, the sun doesn\u2019t always shine and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow, so this nation really needs a great push forward in battery technology. We have some expert people here working in that field, and they\u2019re going to partner in that area. We\u2019re also doing work in semiconductors. In fact, we\u2019re doing a lot of work in semiconductors, but one in particular area is the Center for Harsh Environments Electronics. And so this is a way to harden electronics against both natural and man-made assaults, if you will. Again, you want to make sure that your devices work, even in the worst of circumstances. Again, we have great talent there continuing down that area of research and innovation. We had the state of Texas\u2019 first Blackstone LaunchPad. We were one of three \u2014 so UT Austin and Texas A&M were among the set that was in 2016. I remember, I was transitioning in. We now are sort of the node point for Blackstone investment across UT System, so I think we have a total of 10 of the UT System campuses that are now engaged with Blackstone. But again, we\u2019re at the node point of that. I also want to point out the Venture Development Center, which does such incredibly good work. We\u2019ve spun out a great many new companies. And a lot of them get a real boost, a real leg up by working with the Venture Development Center and it includes things like fume hoods and dry and wet labs. I mean we really make it possible for people with a great technological idea to sort of get through that zone, which is hard for many to get it to a commercial standpoint. So again, the Venture Development Center is a big asset for us. And as we look here, too, we also see that we collaborate with the Capital Factory. This is actually a world-renowned entrepreneurial center. It\u2019s headquartered in Austin, and I think we\u2019re the only University that actually sits on their Innovation Council. It\u2019s interesting the Capital Factory has figured out that there\u2019s some pretty good work going on here in Dallas \u2014 most notably here at UT Dallas. Again, you can see some of the projects that come by way of that, and the Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship is the heart of that. I mean that\u2019s what gives us that connection. So out of this work we\u2019ve had any number of successes. In fact, I\u2019ve learned that over 500 new companies have been started over the last five years. But maybe more notably is that we\u2019ve had five major acquisitions in just the last year and a half. The one that we\u2019re featuring right here is CerSci Therapeutics and you see the co-founders \u2014 Lucas Rodriguez is a recent PhD graduate; his mentors are Ted Price \u2014 also a UTD alum \u2014 and Greg Dussor. What\u2019s notable here is that they treat pain, but without opioids, and as you know, we have a terrible crisis in the U.S. with opioid addiction. These folks are doing some incredibly important work and this is one of the most important spin-outs that we\u2019ve had. All right, let me continue with on update on diversity, equity and inclusion. Here you see Yvette Pearson, our relatively new VP for ODEI, along with Raul Hinojosa, as they move into new space over in the Administration Building. I think you\u2019re out there somewhere. Calvin Jamison\u2019s also smiling in the picture, along with me. We\u2019ve been able to bring together a lot of the different offices that have been part of this extended effort that were in very scattered places and really now it\u2019s been all located in the Administration Building. This has been a nice, nice new development for us. One of the things I really appreciated and I think Vice President Pearson deserves an awful lot of credit for this, but if you look here you see a lot of external initiatives \u2014 competitive initiatives \u2014 where we\u2019ve been able to go to other agencies. You see that we became a charter member of the SEA Change initiative, which is part of the American Association for the Advancement of Science or AAAS. You see down below an S-STEM Grant, which benefits our Johnson School of Engineering and Computer Science. Again, this is a competitive NSF-funded project, and I know that Dr. Pearson has also initiated regular conferences or meetings with the other chief diversity officers all around the UT System. So again, this is just a great way that keeps us connected with a broader community, and we have some very strong programs that have been in place for any number of years. The Multicultural Center in particular has a long and wonderful record of achievement. But here you see a couple factoids such as the number of Diversity Scholars and how well that they are doing at UTD. You also see outreach initiatives like the Young Women in Science and Engineering Investigators program. These are really fine programs that help build outreach to other communities, but also make sure that people are successful once they get here. Other initiatives \u2014 DiversAbility Summit, coffee with veterans and a veterans annual lunch, Native American Heritage Month, Employee Resource Groups \u2014 this is a Drum Caf\u00e9, and I understand people played drums \u2014 but the ERGs \u2014 the Employee Research Groups \u2014 are also very important. These are communities of individuals with shared interests, and it\u2019s really important to help build a kind of camaraderie, if you will, and a sense of belonging. So the ERGs are very important to us. We also have the Diversity Awards Dinner, which is just a lovely event every year. The Galerstein Gender Center, now led by Matt Winser-Johns, who was then recognized \u2014 was recently recognized \u2014 by Mayor Voelker of the City of Richardson during Pride Month. Way to go, Matt. And we\u2019re considered to be Texas\u2019s most LGBT-friendly campus, which we\u2019re very proud of, very proud of. Let me transition now into the numbers part, so again, Larry Redlinger, if you\u2019re out there, this is your zone. This \u2014 all of it comes out of our Strategic Plan. It goes back to 2018, when we first wrote the plan. We then updated it in 2021 and, I like to point out, that when we look at these numbers, they\u2019re important, but they\u2019re not the only things that are important, right. Not everything that\u2019s important to this University can be measured in some of this data. But you\u2019ll see pretty much that we\u2019re doing a good job. So in this first chart you see that our target is for \u2014 we\u2019re trying to get to \u2014 about 33,000-35,000 students by Academic Year 2025. And so we\u2019re moving forward very, very well with the number of undergrads. The graduate chart is really interesting. So again, you see it declining after Academic Year \u201916. This predates the pandemic. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on it, but there were a lot of graduate students who were thinking maybe the U.S. isn\u2019t such a welcoming place to go for higher education. And so we saw some decline in numbers; they were starting to turn around when COVID hit. So you can see in Academic Year \u201921, we just lost a boatload of those students. They simply couldn\u2019t come into the country, but they were coming back by Academic Year \u201922. And now look at Academic Year \u201923; it\u2019s a record. I mentioned earlier in this talk that the number of master\u2019s degrees that we had awarded had dropped. But with these numbers, we\u2019re going to see that start to go back up again. Most master\u2019s students are going to be here for about two years maybe, maybe a little less. So, doctoral graduates. Again as I mentioned earlier, we were doing right around 200 for the longest time, but we\u2019ve really stepped it up. We\u2019re in a good spot now, and we will hit that target of 275 by Academic Year \u201925. First-time-in-college, freshman cohort. You see good numbers. Our target was 3,900; we reached it by \u201920, dropped below it in \u201921. Same story, back above. We\u2019re attracting those first-year students that we mean to have here. Academic space. So Calvin Jamison is out in the audience \u2014 we\u2019re moving forward on this one. We\u2019re trying to get to 2.4 million square feet of assignable space and we\u2019re making pretty good progress on that. For the sake of time, I won\u2019t tell you what\u2019s coming next, because that\u2019s later in my talk. But some good things are coming down the pike. Tenure system faculty. Now this is an interesting chart. We haven\u2019t gained that much. Last year was a good year. COVID of course was tough, but we\u2019re trying to get to 625 by Academic Year \u201925. That\u2019s real essentially two years from now, and this is going to be a challenge. So to the deans in the audience and a few others \u2014 on Friday, I put out a memo declaring that we are going to hire 50 additional faculty lines over and above any replacement \u2014 over and above any aggressive hiring that we are currently doing. And we are. This has gained a lot of support. As I look at some of my deans, you know we\u2019re really looking to you for great ideas here; and this is a rare opportunity to do things that normally you couldn\u2019t do, when you can only add two or three. Now you can add more like seven or eight, and you could actually start a cluster hire across schools; you could maybe start new degree programs and even new departments. Let\u2019s think along those lines and get aggressive. We have the support. I think Terry Pankratz is in the room, but you know we\u2019ve managed our budgets pretty well. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen the University\u2019s budget in better shape than it is right now. Now we can do it and we\u2019re going to do it. Expenditures. I\u2019ve been talking about this quite a lot. I don\u2019t need to say it again, but you see great growth in the federal research expenditures. Four- and six-year graduation rates. We\u2019ve pretty much hit our targets, so I\u2019m really happy with that. This is a very hard data point to move because what happens, by definition, you have to look back four years to see what\u2019s happening now, in terms of four-year graduation rate. You have to look back six years in terms of what is the six-year graduation rate. We know that a lot of the attrition occurs right after the first year, so if you don\u2019t make it from that freshman year to the sophomore year, you can\u2019t really recover those individuals. We\u2019re doing a very good job \u2014 we have great mentoring programs in place. I haven\u2019t talked about things like Orbit and the like, but again, we have very good programs in place that especially are aimed at helping those students who are in their first year. And that\u2019s not just freshmen. That could be new transfer students; it could be new graduate students. We also want to make sure that new international students also get a special level of mentoring to make sure that they make it through the toughest year \u2014 the first year. Our endowment. This is going in a great direction. Kyle Edgington and company are doing great work. The big jump up in \u201922 \u2014 we can thank the stock market for that and the loss in \u201923, we can again thank the stock market for that. You know the stock market gives and it takes away. By the way, it\u2019s going back up again. We\u2019re in great shape. We\u2019ll hit the 800 target in part because of the New Dimensions comprehensive campaign that\u2019s underway and, again, I have a slide on that, so let\u2019s continue going forward. This last year, we did an Employee Climate Survey. And you can see the fraction of individuals who responded \u2014 it was 42 percent staff and 58 faculty. And you can see that staff were more inclined to write comments than were the faculty, and it was about a 50 maybe 60 percent response rate. So in other words, roughly half of the individuals who were asked to return the survey did so. But again, there\u2019s still a lot of people and it helps us understand where we\u2019re going as a university and where we can improve. We had an overall engagement score of 70 percent. That\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not great, to be candid. And this is a reflection of people answering the questions: \u201chow happy are you at UTD?\u201d and \u201cwould you recommend UTD as a great place to work?\u201d I also point out that this did occur during COVID, when people were really under a lot of stress. It\u2019s going to be an interesting benchmark as we go forward. And we will do longitudinal studies on this, just to make sure that the trends are going where we want them to go. You also see here lists of strengths and improvements. This is University-wide. I hasten to add, having been through many of these surveys you know as a department head and as a dean and now as a president, these things vary significantly from one unit to another. So I have to be careful in drawing conclusions for that University average. We\u2019re not doing great. What would matter to me back when I was a dean or department head is I wanted to know what was happening in my unit. And we have that data and so we\u2019ve shared it. In fact that takes me to my next slide. We actually had a Campus Climate Survey Committee go through all of this, including synthesizing the written comments, and to give sort of a path of action, if you will. This is targeted again for specific units, so we are looking to see responses as needed in the various areas. We\u2019re going to stay on top of this and make sure that we make UTD always a better place to work. Amanda Rockow\u2019s in the room. We\u2019re looking ahead now to the next legislative session, the 88th. Again, for the sake of time, I won\u2019t dig too deeply into this, but you see our four main priorities. First and foremost, always, is formula funding \u2014 so you know that the state gives money to the public universities based on the number of students that they have, based on what they\u2019re studying, whether they are grad students, undergrad, etc. And as one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing universities, we tend to do rather well on formula funding. But much depends on whether the state in general is doing well, if they put enough into the pot. So even if our piece of the pie \u2014 I\u2019m mixing my metaphors \u2014 even if our piece of the pie gets wider, if the pie gets smaller, well you know, all bets are off. But this is a good year financially for the State of Texas, so we\u2019re hoping that with our enrollment growth and the state doing well, we should do okay there. And we have two programs that really augment what we\u2019re doing as a tier one research university: the Texas Research Incentive Program is a scheme where, if people give money through philanthropic means to support our research, the state will match it, or at least up to a one-to-one match; and the National Research University Fund is, in essence, an endowment and, if you meet certain metrics to prove to the state that you truly are of a national level in research, then you can draw on that endowment. There\u2019s only four schools that have met that level for NRUF and it\u2019s Houston, Texas Tech, ourselves and now UT Arlington. We\u2019re one of only four schools in the state that can draw on that. We also have a major request \u2014 $54 million to advance key initiatives, which in the past would have been called special items. Let me just talk a little bit. So here\u2019s TRIP \u2014 some of the researchers that you saw have benefited from TRIP. Again, people have contributed to their research. The good news is the state stands ready \u2014 almost ready \u2014 to put money behind that to match the funds. But the bad news is they haven\u2019t really been replenishing the pot at any good clip. So, in fact, the last matched gift was from September 2016. And that was before I gave my very first State of the University address. I was, I think, two months in on my job; so we\u2019re trying very hard to get the state to wipe out that backlog. We have $60 million in the backlog, and so we\u2019re hoping something good will come out of this session. And in terms of exceptional items or special items, we have four areas that we\u2019re trying to put in front of the state for their support. One is the North Texas Semiconductor R&D Hub. Again, I think you know that there\u2019s a major, major problem in the United States with the supply of microprocessors and chips. There\u2019s been a major national initiative in CHIPS for America. And you know we invented the darn thing \u2014 not we \u2014 but people here in North Texas \u2014 invented it. So there you see Jack Kilby, who got the Nobel Prize for this. How many universities have a statue of Jack Kilby on their campus? And of course a very fine cleanroom, which is \u2014 all joking aside \u2014 is not to be surpassed by any other university. So we stand ready to really contribute to this, so we hope that the state will help us in that effort. I mentioned earlier that we\u2019re doing work in non-opioid pain treatment, so again we\u2019re hoping maybe they\u2019ll make a $10 million effort in that area. Academic Bridge Program is an outreach effort which has been in place for quite some time now, mostly to DISD and other area schools, and it helps bring people from maybe lower-income households to UTD, and make sure that they have success. It\u2019s a proven program; it works; it involves a lot of mentoring and it scales with however much money the state gives us. So we can have that many more students if we can get some additional money. And the Crow Museum of Asian Art. I think you all know that we acquired the Crow Collection about almost three years ago now, and this is to help us with some of the educational initiatives that we would surround with that. We want to take this wonderful asset and be able to help teach people how to curate art, how to maintain the art. And so we\u2019re hoping that the state might support us in that endeavor. We also need infrastructure. I like to point out that we have a high student-to-everything ratio. We have a high student-to-teacher ratio, a high student-to-staff ratio and a high student-to-classroom seat ratio. So we\u2019re trying to \u2014 even though the infrastructure has grown at a tremendous clip \u2014 we\u2019re trying to get a few more additional facilities. So in the middle you see the multidisciplinary Science and Technology Building. Those of you who are familiar with the Bioengineering and Sciences Building or BSB \u2014 it would be like a duplicate of that. It\u2019d be like another one of those, to a first approximation. Biomedical engineering and science is the fastest growing part of our research portfolio and more and more people are coming, including faculty, staff and students to work in this area. So we just simply have to have the facilities to support them. Academic facilities and renovations projects. This is something that in some way is kind of new here. This University is so new that we don\u2019t have much in the way of deferred maintenance. But as we do age, there are a lot of our buildings really need to be upgraded for modern work that we\u2019re doing, the research work that we\u2019re doing. And off to the left is the new Student Union. Let me click to the next slide. So our students \u2014 and you heard from our Student Government president \u2014 that students last week \u2014 or maybe was two weeks ago \u2014 voted in favor to increase their Student Union fee to a hundred dollars per semester, effective next year. And it would help fund this new Student Union that we would like to have. So if you\u2019re familiar with the current Student Union, it was designed for a student body one-third the current size and it was a very fine Student Union back then. It is not a fine Student Union now. I mean it\u2019s just stressed and so we just simply have got to build a bigger facility to support this. So our next step is we have to get the Texas Legislature to approve \u2014 which means a bill has to be introduced in both the House and the Senate \u2014 to in fact build upon what the students voted to do. It\u2019s not a trivial matter, so we\u2019re working very hard now to get legislative approval. The Student Pub is being remodeled. I mentioned we have a great esports team, so we\u2019re kind of building, we\u2019re taking the Pub and really turning it into more of an esports gaming arena. But it can be used not just for esports, for other things like comedy acts or poetry slams, things like that. So that\u2019s coming soon to the current Student Union. And here you see the DART Silver Line. This is something kind of dear to my heart. On the north side of Northside is where the Silver Line will pass. we had a ribbon cutting \u2014 I guess we don\u2019t have a picture of the ribbon cutting \u2014 but again if you know where Northside is, to the north side is where the train will come in. The station is already under construction, so we\u2019re taking care of our end of the deal. Thank you, Calvin. We don\u2019t exactly know when the train\u2019s coming, so I hear variously \u2014 2024 \u2014 but just this morning, from the DART president \u2014 it might be later in \u201925. But in any event we want that train to come. It\u2019ll go all the way out to the DFW airport and I\u2019ve got to tell my joke. So when the train leaves it goes \u201cwhoosh.\u201d Thank you for pretending that was funny. Another major development for us, and again how many times have I said that biomedical, biomedical engineering science, is the fastest growing part of our portfolio, research portfolio? This is a shared building with UT Southwestern. It was quite a few years in the making. We teamed up because we really have a lot to contribute to one another. We don\u2019t have a medical school but we know one \u2014 UT Southwestern. And they\u2019re very, very good. They have I think six Nobel Prize laureates on their staff and, needless to say, they have the clinical data; they have the medical research expertise. But we\u2019ve got the engineering and the science areas, like nanotechnology, big data imaging, and we\u2019ve worked very well with them over quite a few years. So we already have a major area of overlap with UT Southwestern. Not everything that we do in biomedical science and engineering is done with Southwestern, but maybe half of it is, I mean. So a good chunk is. We went in together to try to get support from the state to build this building that you see on the slide. We were not successful with the state, but later UT System did step forward. So, using the Permanent University Fund or PUF, they contributed $90 million toward a $120 million building. The reason why you see the Texas Instruments name there is that they gave us a lead gift of $15 million to help make this building a reality, and we\u2019ll walk through the doors around September of next year. So we\u2019re less than a year away. It\u2019s also going to be a future home to the Biodesign Center. So, again, this is very much a UTD kind of expertise. So we have talked about innovation and the like and commercialization. So this Biodesign Center is going to be an interesting element in this new building. And something again very dear to my heart \u2014 the Athenaeum. So we again broke ground on the Athenaeum about half a year back and it\u2019s now called the Edith and Peter O\u2019Donnell Jr. Athenaeum, thanks to a $32 million gift that came from the O\u2019Donnell Foundation. So, again, I think many of you in the room understand what this is. This is a complex of buildings, the first of which is for the visual arts and at the heart of it will be the Crow Museum of Asian Art, which is one of the great collections of Asian art in the country. And I always like to point out that there\u2019s already a Crow Museum. It\u2019s downtown in the Arts District in Dallas. If you\u2019ve never been there, please go. It\u2019s a jewel; it\u2019s a gem; it\u2019s just wonderful. But they can only display 15 percent of their art right now. They\u2019ll be able to now display about 85 percent of the art after this facility opens. And this building will open in the spring of \u201924, so maybe April, May, around that time frame of 2024. And following that will be a performance hall, a 600- to 800-seat performance hall. So again, this is for the performing arts and again this is really important to us at UTD. I\u2019d like to point out that we have a lot of folks majoring in STEM disciplines, but I speak as one who as an engineering student played a lot of music. I know that the arts is really important to our students \u2014 both to listen to it or see it, you know, to engage in it, but also to create it. And so this is going to be a significant new addition just to the whole environment of UTD. This is, I don\u2019t know, this is as big as it gets. I mean this will completely change UT Dallas in a wonderful way. A few other things. We have more students here, which means other things need to grow. So we have three more Comet Cruisers. Thank you. So if you need to get out and about. I\u2019m in the home stretch now. You\u2019ve got to eat, so we got a few more places to eat and we\u2019ve sort of embedded the Tech Store now in the UT Dallas Bookstore. A little bit more in the way of dining options. We\u2019re not showing our robots this time around. I\u2019ve shown it in the past, but you know a robot will deliver your food if you like. Here\u2019s Northside. This is awfully important to us. It was in my first year that we opened Phase One and we\u2019ve now opened Phase Four. So I\u2019ve made reference now to Northside several times. Before we had Northside there was no college town. I mean the surrounding areas maybe were undeveloped, or you know residential areas \u2014 all very nice, but this Northside community is a big deal. A lot of our students live there. There\u2019s some shopping, you can get a beer if you want. It\u2019s just a really nice area and you just walk across the street and you\u2019re on campus. And as I mentioned \u2014 so all the way to the, to the top or the left \u2014 is where the Silver Line will pass through. So when that DART Rail passes through, it\u2019s going to be a major development for Northside, but especially for UTD. And I also want to tip my hand late in the talk to our Office of Information Technology. So we all had to do a crash course in shifting to online teaching and learning in the spring of 2020, and everybody stepped up. I mean everybody \u2014 our faculty, staff and students \u2014 all did. But OIT was so vital in all of this. These are the geeky people who know how it all works, and I can\u2019t say enough about how well they served this University during that time. And just one little touch \u2014 here\u2019s what they call the TechKnowledgy Bar. It\u2019s in the Student Union; it\u2019s a high traffic area. It\u2019s just a drop-in site; so if you\u2019ve got a problem with your computer and you just need someone to tell you how to fix it or maybe fix it themselves, you can just drop in there. I\u2019ve walked by that place many times. It\u2019s always busy there. There are always people there. OK. So as I mentioned we have a capital campaign. We\u2019re trying to do even more. You know we can only go so far with the amount of money that we can expect from the state and we can only ask our students to pay so much in tuition, so we have a capital campaign or a comprehensive campaign underway. The goal is $750 million. We\u2019ve raised $317 million at this point. You see two very distinguished UTD graduates who are co-leading this campaign externally. So Ron Nash on the left and John Olajide on the right. And John was our commencement speaker last spring. Very dynamic, very accomplished individuals and they\u2019re helping drive this campaign in a really good direction. And I think that kind of does it. So for some of you who\u2019ve been waiting a long time. Thank you. We always like to say \u201cthank you\u201d to you for your hard work and by asking you not to work on a particular day. And so Comets United Day is going to be Friday, Dec. 23. So it\u2019s not a vacation day, yet. But now it is, now it is. So OK, that\u2019s my talk. Thanks for listening. 800 W.

    "title":"Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering \u2013 The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Modern engineering systems, for example, microelectronics, transportation, nanotechnology, telecommunications, energy systems, or robotics, are increasingly complex and interdisciplinary. A degree in systems engineering gives students the necessary design skills to integrate components and technologies across many disciplines. Systems engineering also trains students to understand the role of business and entrepreneurship in the design of complex engineering systems and to take on leadership roles in multidisciplinary teams in many application areas. The systems engineering program provides a solid foundation in system architecture, project management, and system design, as well as a rigorous introduction to more advanced topics, such as data analytics, dynamical systems, optimization, modeling and simulation, and complex networks. Students take 123 hours to graduate, including 42 hours from the University\u2019s core curriculum and 75 hours in the major. A unique feature of the systems engineering degree program is the Secondary Field requirement, which consists of 15 credit hours that give students flexibility to tailor their own curriculum. Students may choose from a list of pre-approved secondary fields, such as robotics or healthcare systems, or design their own secondary field, in consultation with an advisor. Engineering education requires strong high school preparation. Pre-engineering students should take at least one semester in trigonometry and one year each in elementary algebra, intermediate and advanced algebra, plane geometry, chemistry and physics; this background makes it possible to move immediately into demanding college courses in calculus, calculus-based physics and advanced mathematics. Students also should be able to read rapidly and with comprehension, and to write clearly and correctly. Gaining experience in engineering practice is an important component of a well-rounded education. The Jonsson School operates a successful internship program that averages more than 1,000 undergraduate and graduate student placements a year at Dallas-area companies. A dedicated staff in the Industrial Practice Programs (IPP) office is available to help students find and prepare for internship opportunities.

    "title":"Bachelor of Arts in Economics \u2013 The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Economists study how people make choices in life in response to the incentives that they face. It is the foundation for business decision-making. Economists examine all types of markets, the means and strategies for profit maximization, industrial and labor organizations, the distribution of income and ownership rights, governmental activities and political and economic philosophies, and analyze how these and other factors influence the production of goods and services. Most economists are concerned with the practical applications of tools of economic decision-making and analysis as they relate to firm, industry and government operations. There are many types of economists, including business economists, labor economists, macroeconomists, public finance economists, behavioral economists and game theorists. Economics is a broad-ranging discipline that covers issues such as pricing and production, profit maximization, data analytics, forecasting, the effect of incentives on urban development, or how to counteract a terrorist organization. In the private sector, economists use their understanding of economic relationships to help firms set prices, forecast growth and analyze the impact of government regulations and global economic trends. An economics degree also is considered excellent preparation for law school or for pursuing an MBA. As a group, economics majors are known to score the highest on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). The University\u2019s Career Center is an important resource for students pursuing their career.

    "title":"Bachelor of Science in Economics \u2013 The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"Economists study how people make choices in life in response to the incentives that they face. It is the foundation for business decision-making. Economists examine all types of markets, the means and strategies for profit maximization, industrial and labor organizations, the distribution of income and ownership rights, governmental activities and political and economic philosophies, and analyze how these and other factors influence the production of goods and services. Most economists are concerned with the practical applications of tools of economic decision-making and analysis as they relate to firm, industry and government operations. There are many types of economists, including business economists, labor economists, macroeconomists, public finance economists, behavioral economists and game theorists. Economics is a broad-ranging discipline that covers issues such as pricing and production, profit maximization, data analytics, forecasting, the effect of incentives on urban development, or how to counteract a terrorist organization. In the private sector, economists use their understanding of economic relationships to help firms set prices, forecast growth and analyze the impact of government regulations and global economic trends. An economics degree also is considered excellent preparation for law school or for pursuing an MBA. As a group, economics majors are known to score the highest on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). The University\u2019s Career Center is an important resource for students pursuing their career.

Employees who must be on campus to work but are not required to be on campus during an emergency will be assigned alternative duties by their supervisor to be performed remotely. Alternative duties may include but are not limited to professional development, monitoring emails or websites, assisting other units, or being on call to respond and assist their unit, department or UTD, as needed. Supervisors are to be understanding and flexible in their expectations of work performed if employees are balancing their work duties with caregiving for family or experiencing utility outages due to inclement weather.

    "content":"Correction : An earlier version of this email did not include the names of Peter Balyta, Ph.D., and Mike Calhoun as members of the search committee. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AUSTIN, TX (November 25, 2024) \u2013 The University of Texas (UT) System Board of Regents Chairman Kevin P. Eltife recently announced the appointment of a search advisory committee to support the regents and chancellor on selecting the next president of The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). Additionally, the UT System has launched a dedicated website at https:\/\/www.utsystem.edu\/utdallas-presidential-search to provide the public with information about the search, including a regularly updated timeline of search activities and a portal for the university community and members of the public to submit candidate nominations confidentially. UT Dallas President Richard Benson recently announced his plan to step down and transition to a faculty role at UTD following the 2024-2025 academic year, concluding nine years of exceptional leadership in which the university has experienced significant increases in research expenditures, enrollment and graduation rates. \u201cThe University of Texas at Dallas continues a remarkable trajectory as a leading state and national university, marked by unprecedented growth in research, groundbreaking campus expansions, and a commitment to excellence in all disciplines of study,\u201d Eltife said. \u201cAs we look ahead, the Board of Regents is focused on building upon this strong foundation and is eager to select a successor to President Benson who will propel UTD forward with the same level of forward movement,\u201d he added. UT System Chancellor James B. Milliken, who will chair the UT Dallas presidential search advisory committee, emphasized the significance of this search as a pivotal moment in maximizing its future. \u201cUT Dallas is a premier university in Texas and a highly regarded rising star on the national stage. We plan to identify leaders who can harness the significant opportunities before us. The insights and deep commitment of the search advisory committee will be invaluable in this process,\u201d said Milliken. Search advisory committee members were appointed in accordance with Board of Regents\u2019 Rules and Regulations, including a provision for representation by various constituencies that are both internal and external to the institution. This includes faculty, administration, alumni, students, and community members. Representation on the UT Dallas Presidential Search Advisory Committee includes: Committee Chair: UT System Board of Regents UT System UT Institution Presidents UTD Staff UTD Student UTD Faculty UTD Dean UTD Alumnus Community Members The University of Texas at Dallas 800 W.

    "content":"Dear Colleagues, The deadline for undergraduate mid-semester grades is Saturday, Oct. 12. The purpose of mid-semester grading is to make sure students are aware of their progress and current standing in all their classes. This is a good time for faculty to benefit from checking up on how things are going on our end as well. On behalf of the Committee on Effective Teaching (CET) , I recommend that you consider gathering feedback from students about their learning experiences in your courses. This is unofficial and completely optional; no one other than you will see your students\u2019 responses. The rationale is that gathering feedback from students allows you to make changes this semester or in the future, and help students better understand and benefit from aspects of the course you cannot or will not change. The University Assessment Committee suggests two questions to ask students: You can use a survey tool in eLearning to gather feedback from your students, or an external tool such as Qualtrics . Note that directing students to answer only two questions, and thus to prioritize their responses, is intended to make the feedback more productive for the instructor. You may ask more detailed follow-up questions if you wish or use a different set of questions entirely. I strongly recommend condensing the feedback and going over it with your class . You can try to identify places where you can improve, make changes, etc. There are likely to be comments about some things that you simply cannot or will not change (e.g., \u201ctoo much reading!\u201d), but knowing that students are having difficulty in a particular area can lead you to assist them with these difficulties. We all know that UTD is committed to teaching excellence, and we all demonstrate that commitment in the choices we make in our teaching every day.

    "content":"November 20, 2023 When three large rocks were placed near the UT Dallas Activity Center in 2008, the plan was for them to be painted in a manner that promoted school activities and events and to grow school spirit. Students have used the rocks to support such things as homecoming, new student orientation, athletic activities and graduation. For several weeks, messages on the rocks have been inconsistent with their original purpose and guidelines. After careful consideration, the rocks have been removed. The spirit rocks were not intended to be a display for extended political discourse, and because painted messages have been negatively impacting people on and off campus, our best solution was to remove them. The freedom of speech, expression and assembly are fundamental rights and central to the mission of the University, and there are numerous ways for students to express their opinions . We are proud of our diverse student body, and it is our hope that UTD students will continue to discuss local, national and world issues with empathy, kindness and respect.

Greg Abbott has directed all Texas state agencies \u2014 including The University of Texas at Dallas \u2014 to \u201cban its officers and employees from downloading or using TikTok on any of its government-issued devices. This TikTok ban extends to all state-issued cellphones, laptops, tablets, desktop computers and other devices capable of internet connectivity.\u201d The governor\u2019s memo to state agency leaders (pdf) indicates that TikTok software poses a threat to our \u201cstate\u2019s sensitive information and critical infrastructure\u201d because it \u201charvests vast amounts of data from its users\u2019 devices.\u201d To comply with this order, UT Dallas is requiring that TikTok software be deleted from all University-owned computing devices and that these devices should no longer be used to access the TikTok website. TikTok software should not be downloaded to University-owned computing devices in the future. Additionally, UT Dallas schools and departments should suspend their marketing and communication activities on TikTok and archive existing accounts. University-owned devices only include those that are wholly owned by the University. At this time, no changes are planned that will impact personally owned computing devices. Further guidance about the governor\u2019s order is expected in early 2023, which may lead to additional changes. If any employee has questions about this statewide requirement or believes they have a legitimate University purpose for keeping TikTok software installed on University-owned computing devices, please contact the OIT Help Desk .

    "title":"Living Our Values Task Force - The University of Texas at Dallas",
    "content":"In June 2020, UT Dallas formed a Living Our Values Task Force with a goal of discussing issues of systemic racism, inherent bias, equity, diversity, access and inclusion within the campus community. In late May 2020, a group of UT Dallas students sent an email to the University\u2019s president, Dr. Richard C. Benson, that outlined concerns about racial equity, inclusion and diversity on campus. In response, the University created the Living Our Values Task Force composed of students, faculty and staff. The primary goal was to develop recommendations for the University administration and president to consider. Tamara Havis, a computer engineering senior and one of six student representatives who initially reached out to Dr. Benson to request changes, said the task force process involved more than 300 hours of volunteer service. \u201cUTD cannot accept the positivity of having different cultures without acknowledging the detriments that some of the cultures face in their heritage \u2014 such as systematic racism toward Black people. And with the creation of the task force, it is my hope the University is working to change that,\u201d she said. Such changes will require a sustained effort by the entire University to make campus welcoming and comfortable for Black students. This task force is vital for the advancement of our University. I am asking the team to have candid conversations and develop recommendations that make UT Dallas a better, more inclusive and respectful place for all to live and learn. UT Dallas President Richard C. Benson , the Eugene McDermott Distinguished University Chair of Leadership In September 2020, the task force presented its recommendations to UT Dallas administrators, and Dr. Benson supported the following: Develop and approve proposals for new minors in African and African diaspora studies and\/or ethnic studies as a first step toward exploring degree programs in these areas. The Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology offers a range of courses on African American history and literature that could become part of a new minor program. Form a police oversight committee to promote transparency between the UT Dallas Police Department (UTDPD) and the University community. The oversight committee initially was recommended by a police task force formed prior to the Living Our Values Task Force, which endorsed its creation. The oversight committee would receive quarterly reports from the chief of police on arrests, use-of-force incidents, citations issued and any complaints made against UTD officers. It also would work with the police department to identify and promote outreach opportunities for UTDPD in the University community, survey the community about its attitudes toward the department and host a forum for the public to ask questions of UTDPD leadership at least twice per year. Ensure fraternities and sororities educate members on the University\u2019s nondiscrimination policy and promote cultural intelligence training for all UT Dallas fraternity and sorority members. Commit to providing additional diversity and inclusion training for faculty and staff, especially supervisors. In addition, the University will conduct a campus climate survey and needs assessment and continue to support Employee Resource Groups to help attract and retain a diverse community and foster a welcoming culture on campus. Expand outreach and recruitment efforts for underrepresented student populations with an emphasis on schools in the Dallas Independent School District and surrounding districts in historically underserved communities. The task force is working to transition its charge to structures within the University that are better suited to addressing issues that require longer-term, structural solutions. Students, staff, faculty, alumni and the community are encouraged to submit feedback to the Living Our Values Taskforce.

GIS graduates will master the knowledge and skills to spatially integrate data and computing resources for informed decision-making in environmental modeling, business intelligence, precision agriculture, smart cities, public safety and community resilience, just to name a few. Recent technological innovations have greatly enhanced our ability to collect and analyze massive environmental, social and economic data about places as well as individuals. Now more than ever before, unmanned aviation vehicles (UAV) equipped with remote sensors provide near-real time imagery whenever they are needed. LiDAR point clouds enable us to build high-resolution 3D models of buildings, trees and terrains. Location-based services and mobile geospatial apps allow us to search information based on proximity to our locations and connect our social networks in both physical and cyberspaces. From Microsoft and Apple to Google, and from the United Nations to indigenous communities, geospatial information science and technologies play an essential role for social-environmental inventory, planning, and forecasting of food, water, energy and health. These technologies include geographic information systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) and satellite-based remote sensing. They penetrate virtually every aspect of our lives, from digital maps in cars to the maintenance of city infrastructure, precision agriculture and forest management. GIS has revolutionized traditional disciplines such as geography and inspired scientists from a broad range of fields to combine efforts on leading-edge research. GIS graduates will encounter a wide variety of career options, as businesses and governments race to take advantage of technological advances. They may work in areas such as public administration, smart cities, transportation planning, geospatial intelligence, emergency response, public health and environmental sustainability.
